## Grading
Your score in this competition will reflect your final grade for the project. Your grade will be greater than 5 only if you manage to beat the baseline submission. The grades will be given based on the final ranking as follows:

 - The top 30 competitors can receive a full grade (10 out of 10)
 - The following 30 competitors (ranks 31 to 60) can receive a grade up to 9
 - The following 30 competitors (ranks 61 to 90) can receive a grade up to 8
 - The following 20 competitors (ranks 91 to 110) can receive a grade up to 7
 - The following 20 competitors (ranks 111 to 130) can receive a grade up to 6
 - All other competitors will receive the grade 5 (given that they manage to beat the baseline)

## Project Documentation
Your grade will be given only if you provide the code and a documentation for the proposed approaches. The documentation should include:

 - The description of your machine learning approaches including the tested models (k-NN, SVM, MLP, etc.). Details should also include feature extraction (if present) and hyperparameter choices (learning rate, performance function, regularization, etc.). A minimum of two pages (excluding tables and figures) is expected. Documenting all the tried approaches (even unsuccessful ones) is important.
 - Classification accuracy rates and confusion matrices for the provided validation set.
 - The python code of your model should include explanatory comments.
 - The *.py files must be placed in the same folder (without organization into subfolders) with the documentation. The folder should be named '{family_name}_{first_name}_{group}'.
 - Competitors must convert *.ipynb files to *.py (failure to comply will result in disqualification).
 - The documentation and the *.py files must be archived in a single *.zip file.

## Important notes regarding the submitted code and documentation:

 - The deadline for submitting the documentation is 21.05.2021 23:59 EEST (2 days after competition ends).
 - Code and documentation is subject to plagiarism verification and can lead to disqualification.
 - The project documentation must be submitted to your lab supervisor by e-mail and presented during week 14, after the competition ends.
