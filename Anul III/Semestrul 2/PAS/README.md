# Programarea Aplicatilor de Simulare

## Notes:
- Grading is based 100% on a final project, representing a full game developed in teams between 5 (min) - 10 (max) people.

- Lab is used only for support efforts, for questions related to the projects. If you donâ€™t have any, use the lab time to work at the project!

- If you have another final project involving a game / simulation app, bring it here and develop it using your team :). E.g., your licence projects!

- Technologies allowed:
  - You can choose one of the engines: Unity, Unreal, CryEngine.
  - You can also choose to implement the game at a lower level using OpenGL, DirectX or Vulkan graphics if you wish!

- Minimal coding tasks for your project. **(6p)**
  - Have something related to AI using either machine learning, pathfinding, trees, etc. **(2p)**
  - Have some physical simulation and/or animation in your game. Use the game engine capabilities or algorithms implemented by your team. **(2p)**
  - Implement something on the graphics side: E.g. A complex post-processing shader if you use one of the game engines, or your customized lightning models if you plan to do the low-level implementation. **(2p)**

- What should your final project contain: **(4p)**
  - (1) 5-10 min presentation of your game and its features 
  - (2) A ppt presenting the architecture, features, technologies used, what is special about your project + proof for the minimal coding task to obtain your grade.
  - (3) Everything should be placed on a public GitHub repository with a demo movie of the game and features
